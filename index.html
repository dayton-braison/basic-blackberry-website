    <p>
        The <b>blackberry</b> is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus <em>Rubus</em> in the family Rosaceae, hybrids among
        these species within the subgenus Rubus, and hybrids between the subgenera Rubus and Idaeobatus. The taxonomy of the
        blackberries has historically been confused because of hybridization and apomixis, so that species have often been
        grouped together and called species aggregates.

    <p>
        What distinguishes the blackberry from its raspberry relatives is whether or not the torus\(receptacle or stem) "picks
        with" (i.e., stays with) the fruit. When picking a blackberry fruit, the torus stays with the fruit. With a raspberry,
        the torus remains on the plant, leaving a hollow core in the raspberry fruit.

        Blackberry leaves are food for certain caterpillars; some grazing mammals, especially deer, are also very fond of the
        leaves. Caterpillars of the concealer moth Alabonia geoffrella have been found feeding inside dead blackberry shoots.
        When mature, the berries are eaten and their seeds dispersed by mammals, such as the red fox, American black bear and
        the Eurasian badger, as well as by small birds.

    <h3>Nutrients</h3>
    <p>
        Cultivated blackberries are notable for their significant contents of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K(table).  A 100-gram serving of raw blackberries supplies 180 kilojoules (43 kcal) of food energy and 5 grams of dietary fiber or 25% of the recommended Daily Value (DV) (table).  In 100 grams, vitamin C and vitamin K contents are
        25% and 19% DV, respectively, while other essential nutrients are low in content (table).
        Blackberries contain both soluble and insoluble fiber components.
        Blackberries are also noted for containing manganese and folic acid.

    <h3>Medicinal</h3>
    <p>
        The leaves are rich in tannin and have antibacterial properties. They have been used medicinally since at least the time of the ancient Greeks. They are made into an astringent tea which is supposed by some to relieve sore throats, mouth ulcers, diarrhoea and thrush.
